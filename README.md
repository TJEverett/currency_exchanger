## Description

This project was an attempt at showing the skills that I learned to make API calls and use the information that was returned. In this project I used the information returned from my API call to calculate the value of the user's inputted amount of money from US Dollars into their choice between: Canadian Dollar, Swiss Franc, Euro, Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, and Singapore Dollar
